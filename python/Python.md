python :-

Python is a versatile, high-level, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It's widely used in various fields, including web development, software development, data science, and machine learning. Python's easy-to-understand syntax and extensive libraries make it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced developers. 

python can be used to handle bigdata and perform data analysis
Python can automated repeated tasks like copying files and folders, renaming and uploading files to server
python can be also used for web scrapping where you can get the data from any websites
python can be used to create web applications, mobile applicateions, desktop applications, s/w testing etc..

	python has a simple syntax and allows developers to wrtie programs with fewer lines thn some other program language
	python runs on interpreter system which executes code line by line
	pyhton spports different platforms like windows, unix,linux etc.
	python is a free opensource techonology 
	python supports object oriented, structural programming and functional programing
	python has large libraries which can be used instead of developing the code from the scratch	
	

variables:
	variables is a container tht holds the data which creates a placeholder in memory and assign with some value.
		x = 10
		name = pushparaj
	variables allows any values and you can assign the varible value using the equal symbol
	variables can be changed on assignment or dynamically using the programming

data types in python: 
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-data-types/


integer :
	Integer value can be any length such as integers 5,10,12,21,-1000 etc
	Python has no restriction on the length of an integer

float:
	Float is used to store floating point numbers like 1.2,9.98,18.8 etc
	it is accurate up to 15 decimal points

complex number:
	A complex number contains an ordered pair, x + y whre x and y denote the real and imaginary parts, respectively
	the complex number like 2.14j,5.1j,4j




String:
	The string can be defined as the sequence of characters represented in the quotation marks
	in python, we can use single, double or triple qutes to define a string like "pushaparaj" , 'pushaparaj'

List:
	List can contain duplicate items.
	List in Python are Mutable. Hence, we can modify, replace or delete the items.
	List are ordered. It maintain the order of elements based on how they are added.
	List allows multiple data types a = [10, 20, "GfG", 40, True] b = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
	[10, 20, "GfG", 40, True] ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
	Accessing items in List can be done directly using their position (index), starting from 0.
	
Tuples:
	A tuple in Python is an immutable ordered collection of elements.
	Tuples are similar to lists, but unlike lists, they cannot be changed after their creation 
			(i.e., they are immutable). 
	Tuples can hold elements of different data types. 
	The main characteristics of tuples are being ordered , heterogeneous and immutable.


Set:
	Python set is an unordered collection of multiple items having different datatypes. 
	In Python, sets are mutable, unindexed and do not contain duplicates. 
	The order of elements in a set is not preserved and can change.  eg:{1, 2, 3, 4}

Dictonary:
	Python dictionary is a data structure that stores the value in key: value pairs. 
	Values in a dictionary can be of any data type and can be duplicated, whereas keys can't be repeated and must be immutable.  { "name": "Prajjwal", 1: "Python", (1, 2): [1,2,4] }
